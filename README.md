**Crypto Agent** is an advanced multi-agent system designed to automate cryptocurrency market analysis. By combining real-time news scraping with machine learning-based price forecasting, it delivers actionable insights directly to your Telegram.

## ✨ Features

*   **📰 Real-Time News Intelligence**: Automatically scrapes and summarizes the latest crypto news using `DuckDuckGo` search.
*   **🧠 ML-Powered Forecasting**: Utilizes a **LightGBM** model trained on historical price data and technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.) to predict daily price movements.
*   **🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture**: Built on the **Agno** framework, orchestrating specialized agents for news, analysis, and communication.
*   **📱 Instant Alerts**: Delivers formatted daily reports to your Telegram chat.
*   **🐳 Dockerized**: Fully containerized for easy deployment and automated scheduling.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of three main agents orchestrated by a central pipeline:

1.  **News Agent**: Scours the web for the latest sentiment-driving news.
2.  **Crypto Agent**: Fetches market data, generates technical features, and runs the ML model to predict price direction.
3.  **Telegram Agent**: Formats the insights and dispatches them to the user.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.10+**
*   **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (recommended for deployment)
*   **API Keys**:
    *   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: For the Agno agents (Gemini Flash).
    *   `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` & `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: For receiving alerts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-agent.git
cd crypto-agent
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Copy the example environment file and add your credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` with your keys:
```ini
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 3. Train the Model
Before the first run, you need to train the prediction model.
```bash
# Local Python (using uv)
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
python src/train_model.py

# Or via Docker
docker-compose run crypto-agent python src/train_model.py
```

### 4. Run the Agent
The system is configured to run automatically at **07:00** and **14:00** (Asia/Jakarta time).

```bash
# Run the scheduler
python src/scheduler.py

# Or via Docker (runs scheduler by default)
docker-compose up
```

To run a one-off prediction immediately:
```bash
python src/main.py
```
